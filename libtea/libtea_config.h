 * NOTE: the exact timer interval value depends on the CPU frequency, and

 * suitable timer intervals on the following platforms by tweaking and
 * observing the NOP microbenchmark erip results:
 *
 * Intel i7-6700 3.4GHz (Skylake), ucode unknown:        19
 * Intel i7-6500U 2.5GHz (Skylake), ucode unknown:       25
 * Intel i5-6200U 2.3GHz (Skylake), ucode unknown:       28
 * Intel i7-8650U 1.9GHz (Kaby Lake R), ucode unknown:   34
 * Intel i7-8650U 1.9GHz (Kaby Lake R), ucode 0xca:      54
 * Intel i9-9900K 3.6GHz (Coffee Lake R), ucode unknown: 21
 * Intel i5-1035G1 1GHz (Ice Lake), ucode 0x32:         135
 *
 * Please see the paper 'SGX-Step: A Practical Attack Framework for Precise
 * Enclave Execution Control' (Van Bulck et al., SysTEX 2017) and the
 * SGX-Step GitHub repository (https://github.com/jovanbulck/sgx-step) for
 * more details.

 * Once you have established the correct timer interval for your platform,
 * uncomment #define LIBTEA_APIC_TIMER_INTERVAL below and insert the correct interval.
